%         PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section
% headings as marginal notes. It also sets up the paper size as either
% letter or A4. By default, letter was used. If A4 paper is desired,
% comment out the letterpaper lines and uncomment the a4paper lines.
%
% As you can see, the margin widths and section title widths can be
% easily adjusted.
%
% ALSO: Notice that the includefoot option can be commented OUT in order
% to put the PAGE NUMBER *IN* the bottom margin. This will make the
% effective text area larger.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE THE ``of LASTPAGE'' next to each page number,
% see the note about the +LP and -LP lines below. Comment out the +LP
% and uncomment the -LP.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE PAGE NUMBERS, be sure that the includefoot line
% is uncommented and ALSO uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} a few lines
% below.

% \section{Education/ Research Background}
% I am in the final year of my Ph.D. program in Statistics at Iowa State University. The core courses I've taken include 4 courses in methods and 5 in theory. My elective courses covered Bayesian statistics, environmental statistics, spatial statistics, and machine learning. My course background gives me a large breadth of knowledge of the principles and methods of statistics and data science. I have experience in modern visualization methods as a Shiny Developer. My internship, TA work and elective projects have given me the opportunity to work with experts in different fields such as Agriculture, Veterinary Science, and Natural Resource Ecology and Management which has refined my skills in the application of statistics and data science to scientific studies. \\
% 
% My research uses Bayesian hierarchical models to study and forecast the influenza season; I implement sparse supervised-learning techniques, hierarchical non-linear models, and incorporate multiple data sources in a Bayesian framework. I've implemented my analysis in \verb|R| and created \verb|R| packages of my code stored on Github for version control and distribution which demonstrates my skills in software development and software application and maintenance. I am a part of the Center for Disease Control's influenza forecasting competition. I collaborated with another graduate student in Natural Resource Ecology and Management on creating a Bayesian classification model for fish eggs which provided me an opportunity to provide consulting services for a scientist. Our model used fish egg characteristics to try and classify the fish type before they hatched in an effort to asses species invasion which required me to gain knowledge of biological concepts and skill in their quantitative application. \\
